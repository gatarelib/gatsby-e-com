The Nirvana dakota tan leather sofa is that jacket, but in couch form. With super-plush down-filled cushions, a corner-blocked wooden frame, and a leather patina that only gets better with age, the Nirvana will have you looking cool and feeling peaceful every time you take a seat. Looks pretty great with a sheepskin throw, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-in look, like your favorite leather jacket.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":2,"id":"9eda330c-8295-4695-8bba-1b4276e1ecb9"},"title":"Markus Green Love Seat","type":"itemPage","next":{"categories":["sofas"],"name":"Galaxy Blue Sofa","price":"800","image":"../images/products/couch2.png","description":"Easy to love. The Sven in birch ivory looks cozy and refined, like a sweater that a fancy lady wears on a coastal vacation.
